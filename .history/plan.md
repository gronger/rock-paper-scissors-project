## Basic


function playGame
function for creating a user (users choice)
function for computer (computers choice)
if user == "paper" && computer == "scissors"
console.log("computer has won");
## How to ???


How to divide task?
use a Class? (advanced)
functions... would be many functions
use .filter() -- filter into source - if rock is true, is paper true, etc etc
-not a huge project .. maybe can do it 2 times... once with functions and once with class
## git and guthub


git checkout -b branchname --- how to make a new branch
git checkout branchname ---- switch to other branch
git checkout ------- see how many branches u have
we alll work on our own branches
and then PULL request when finished
then someone check pull request
( everyone goes to one branch )


## COMBINING HTML, CSS AND JS
at end of html file
<script src="index.js"></script>
can write css in js file
<button onclick="alertBtn()">
function alertBtn() {
    alert("its working");
}
search DOM on mdn for more
## more
joseph - rock paper scissors lizard spock
abdul - rock paper scissors between more users
---- like tournament
abdul -dom - html
joseph -version of game with Class
rock paper scissors water human
 rock paper scissors water human
rock crushes scissors and human
paper covers rock, floats on water
scissors cut paper and human
water erodes rock, rusts scissors
human writes paper, drinks water
-expand on current game or make other little games?
focus more on planning


## js bootstrap html etc
we can make multiple JS files, vbut add all of them in the end of the HTML with script tags
give buttons an id="hidden"
const hiddenBtn = document.getElementById("hiddenBtn");
addEventListener() - check out the video from Milad
